      HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages
      using a markup language. HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup
      language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages. A markup language
      is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the
      structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for
      the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text
      accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The
      language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the
      text.HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text,
      images, and other content, in order to display it in the required format.
      HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The first-ever version of
      HTML was HTML 1.0, but the first standard version was HTML 2.0, published
      in 1995.
